I developed an interest in housing affordability in the UK and conducted personal research to gain a better understanding. I obtained my datasets from FRED and cleaned and merged multiple datasets. To avoid confusion caused by nominal prices, I adjusted prices for CPI inflation. Nominal prices can be deceiving, and it's difficult to determine the real-term price from a chart alone. By adjusting for inflation, the resulting chart looks radically different, providing a much clearer picture of real prices. Inflation adjustment is essential for gaining a better understanding of prices.
